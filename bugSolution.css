To resolve the issue, ensure that the parent element has a defined width. You can achieve this by setting a fixed width, a percentage width relative to its parent (which also needs to have a defined width), or using other CSS properties such as `min-width` or `max-width` to set boundaries.  Here's an example:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
#parent {
  width: 80%; /* Or a fixed width like 800px */
}

#child {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```
Alternatively, if the intention was to create a relative width from viewport width, consider using `vw` units instead of `calc()`.
```css
#child {
  width: 90vw;
}
```
